# 1. An aim of the project
An aim of the project is to develop a neural network for analyzing correspondence. It will be able to rate the quality of messages and give the user an understanding of the situation in the correspondence. In addition, the network should have a graphic interface for more convenient use.
# 2. Description of the neural network 
The neural network consists of the following main functional blocks:
  1. Registration, authentication and authorization
  2. Correspondence analysis functionality
  3. Functionality for evaluating the quality of messages
  4. Dynamic quality change
  5. Graphic interface for comfortable use
## 2.1. Registration
The process of registering users must be implemented in the graphic interface. The list of required fields:
* telephone number
* email
* password
* confirm the password

After entering these parameters, the user must confirm their phone number with a code.
## 2.2. Correspondence analysis
## 2.3. Evaluating the quality of messages
The neural network will have two systems of evaluating the quality of messages: 10-point scoring system and percentage influence. 

10-point system list:
* 0-2: Blunder
* 3-5: Inaccuracy
* 6: Basic
* 7-8: Excellent
* 9-10: Brilliant
